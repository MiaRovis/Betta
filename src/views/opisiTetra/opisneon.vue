       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>About</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The neon tetra has a slender torpedo-shaped body that reaches no more than an inch and a half in length. What this fish lacks in size, it makes up for in color.<br/>
       From the tip of its nose to the adipose fin, the neon tetra has a bright neon blue stripe. It is believed this bright stripe makes them more readily visible to each other in blackwater conditions.<br/>
        Neon tetras originated from the clear water and blackwater streams and tributaries in the Orinoco and Amazon river basins in Brazil, Columbia, and Peru. <br/>
       hese are regions of blackwaters beneath dense forest canopies that allow very little light to get through.<br/>
        They normally live 4 years in excellent conditions and grow to around 2 inches.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 6 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.<br/>
      A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish with large fins and long tails as the are fin nippers.<br/>
        They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that.<br/>
        Do not keep them with any fish that are known to eat smaller, slim-bodied fish. If the companion fish has a big enough mouth to swallow the cardinal tetra, it is not a suitable tank mate.<br/>
        Ideal tankmates for tetras are rasboras (not every kind!), dwarf gouramis, cory catfish and ramshorns.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The recommended tank size for Neon Tetras is a minimum of 10 gallons.<br/>
       They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.<br/>
      In their natural habitat, neon tetras live in areas of dark water with dense vegetation and roots. Providing a habitat with plenty of low-light hiding places is important. <br/>
      Blackwater extracts or driftwood are often used to darken the water, maintain an acidic pH, and soften the water.<br/>
      Tetras like mild and steady water current. If the current is too strong, they will struggle to swim and will become stressed.</P>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Water parameters</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline"> 
        <P>This species requires a mature tank that has soft, acidic water. More importantly, water chemistry should be stable. This is not a species that does well in a newly started aquarium.<br/>
        Newly set up aquariums are not suitable for neon tetras as they will not tolerate changes that occur during the initial startup cycle.<br/>
        Good water conditions are paramount when it comes to keeping your fish healthy. Poor quality can lead to unnecessary stress or a wide range of diseases. <br/>
      Temperature: 68°F to 79°F<br/>
         Amonia and Nitrite: 0ppm<br/>
    Nitrate: less then 20ppm<br/>
    PH:7<br/>
   GH: 2-10 dGH</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <P>Neon tetras are omnivores, meaning that they will eat both plant and animal material. <br/>
        Fine flake food, small granules, live or frozen brine shrimp or daphnia, and frozen or freeze-dried bloodworms are all good food choices.</p>
