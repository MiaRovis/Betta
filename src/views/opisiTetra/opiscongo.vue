       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The colorful tetras of South America have Old World relatives in the region of the Congo River in Africa. These African counterparts are equally colorful.<br/>
       Congo tetra shows amazing rainbow luminescence along the whole body from back to front. They are generally blue on top, red and gold in the middle, and blue on the belly.<br/>
        These African characin fish are found in the Congo River Basin. They populate streams, tributaries, pools, and marshes, preferring murky, slightly acidic water. <br/>
       They normally live 3 to 5 years in excellent conditions and grow to around 4 inches.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 6 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.<br/>
      A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish with large fins and long tails as the are fin nippers.<br/>
        They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that.<br/>
        Avoid aggressive species, as they will bully your Congo tetras. Do not keep Congo tetras with any fin-nipping fish as the spectacular fins of the males will be destroyed.<br/>
        Ideal tankmates include other tetras, rainbowfish, and Corydoras catfish.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The recommended tank size for Congo Tetras is a minimum of 30 gallons.<br/>
       They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.<br/>
      Congo tetras are fairly hardy, but only if kept in habitats that are maintained correctly. <br/>
    They prefer still, dark, soft, peat-filtered water with low light levels. This can be achieved with dim aquarium lights and floating plants. <br/>
      They like darker substrates and enjoy nibbling on bottom-growing plants.<br/>
    Tetras like mild and steady water current. If the current is too strong, they will struggle to swim and will become stressed.</P>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Water parameters</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline"> 
        <P>This species requires a mature tank that has soft, acidic water. More importantly, water chemistry should be stable. This is not a species that does well in a newly started aquarium.<br/>
       Good water conditions are paramount when it comes to keeping your fish healthy. Poor quality can lead to unnecessary stress or a wide range of diseases. <br/>
      Temperature: 73°F to 82°F<br/>
         Amonia and Nitrite: 0ppm<br/>
       Nitrate: less then 20ppm <br/>
        PH:6.0 - 7.5<br/> 
      GH: 3-18 dGH</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <P>Congo tetras are omnivores; in the wild, they eat insects, worms, plant matter, and algae. <br/>
     As pets, they are easy to feed. They enjoy live, fresh, and flake foods, as well as brine shrimp and blood worms.</p>
