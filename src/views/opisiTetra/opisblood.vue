       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 6 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.<br/>
      A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish with large fins and long tails as the are fin nippers.<br/>
        They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that also but is not bigger than them.<br/>
    Ideal tankmates for tetras are rasboras (not every kind!), gouramis, cory catfish and ramshorns.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The recommended tank size for Bloodfin Tetras is a minimum of 20 gallons.<br/>
       They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.<br/>
      Plants are one of the most important things to introduce into the aquarium. <br/>
      Tetras like mild and steady water current. If the current is too strong, they will struggle to swim and will become stressed.</P>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Bloodfin Tetra enjoy classical flake food, but it’s best to feed them tubifex worms, silk worms, daphnia, brine shrimp, dried food, or frozen food occasionally to make sure they get all the nutrients they need.<br/>
      A varied diet is always the best option; alternate carnivore food with plant or vegetable foods.</p>
