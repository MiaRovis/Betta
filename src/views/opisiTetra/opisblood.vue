       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
 <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 6 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.</p>
 <p>A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.( bigger than 6)</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish with large fins and long tails as the are fin nippers.</p>
        <p>They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that also.</p>
    <p>Ideal tankmates for tetras are rasboras (not every kind!), gouramis, cory catfish and ramshorns.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The recommended tank size for Black Skirt Tetras is a minimum of 15 gallons.</p>
       <p>They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.</p>
      <p>Plants are one of the most important things to introduce into the aquarium. Black Skirt Tetras love big plants that they can explore and swim through. In the wild, the fish feed off the plants as well.</p>
      <P>Tetras like mild and steady water current. If the current is too strong, they will struggle to swim in the water and become stressed.</P>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras are not picky when it comes to food. In the wild, they will feed off plants and consume pretty much any insects they come across.</p>
       <p>They do just fine with nutrient-rich flakes or pellets as their main meals but addition of bloodworms and brine shrimp is always recommended.</p>
