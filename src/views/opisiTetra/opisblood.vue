       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 6 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.</p>
      <p>A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish with large fins and long tails as the are fin nippers.</p>
        <p>They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that also but is not bigger than them.</p>
    <p>Ideal tankmates for tetras are rasboras (not every kind!), gouramis, cory catfish and ramshorns.</p>

        <p>The recommended tank size for Bloodfin Tetras is a minimum of 20 gallons.</p>
       <p>They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.</p>
