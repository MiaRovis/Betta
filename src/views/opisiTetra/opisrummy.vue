       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The most notable part of the Rummy Nose Tetra is its appearance, its bright red nose and panda tail is what makes them stand out among other tetras.</p>
       <p>Althought quite small, they sure do make themselves visible.</p>
        <p>They normally live 5 to 6 years in excellent conditions and grow to around 2 inches.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 10 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.</p>
      <p>A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish that are larger than them.</p>
        <p>They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that.</p>
        <p>Avoid aggressive species as they will bully your Ember tetras.</p>
        <p>Ideal tankmates include other small tetras, rainbowfish, and Corydoras catfish.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The recommended tank size for Rummy nose tetras is a minimum of 20 gallons.</p>
       <p>They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.</p>
      <p> In their natural habitat, they are surrounded by heavy vegetation, so it’s what they’re comfortable with.</p>
    <p>Driftwood and stone are always desirable in their tank as they like to hide.</p>
      <P>Tetras like mild and steady water current. If the current is too strong, they will struggle to swim and will become stressed.</P>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Water parameters</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline"> 
        <p>Good water conditions are paramount when it comes to keeping your fish healthy. Poor quality can lead to unnecessary stress or a wide range of diseases. </p>
      <p>Temperature: 75°F to 84°F</p>
         <p>Amonia and Nitrite: 0ppm</p>
    <p>Nitrate: less then 20ppm </p>
    <p>PH:5.5 - 7.0</p> 
    <p>GH: 2-6 dGH</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <P> They are omnivores and thrive well on plant-based materials and protein. Generally, the fish will eat small bits of plant debris or algae.</P>
      <p>This means a mixed diet of flake fish food and frozen or freeze-dried food is a great place to start.  </p>
        <p>For live food, we recommend Daphnia and brine shrimp as a great source of protein and nutrients.</p>
