       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>These fish are extremely pretty and their bright coloration makes them mesmerizing to watch swim around in your tank.<br/>
        The Ember Tetra is almost entirely orangeish-red and the brightness of their color holds true wherever it’s present on their body. This gives them a very distinct and sharp look that’s impossible to miss.<br/>
        They can be found most heavily in Central Brazil in the Araguaia River basin.<br/>
       They normally live 3 to 6 years in excellent conditions and grow to around 1 inch.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 10 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.<br/>
      A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish that are larger than them.<br/>
        They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that.<br/>
        Avoid aggressive species as they will bully your Ember tetras.<br/>
        Ideal tankmates include other small tetras, rainbowfish, and Corydoras catfish.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The recommended tank size for Ember Tetras is a minimum of 10 gallons.<br/>
       They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.<br/>
       In their natural habitat Ember Tetras are surrounded by heavy vegetation, so it’s what they’re comfortable with.<br/>
    Some of the best plants to include in their tanks are Java Moss, Hornwort, and Anacharis.<br/>
      Tetras like mild and steady water current. If the current is too strong, they will struggle to swim and will become stressed.</P>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Water parameters</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline"> 
        <p>Good water conditions are paramount when it comes to keeping your fish healthy. Poor quality can lead to unnecessary stress or a wide range of diseases. <br/>
      Temperature: 73°F to 84°F<br/>
         Amonia and Nitrite: 0ppm<br/>
    Nitrate: less then 20ppm <br/>
    PH:5.0 - 6.5<br/>
    GH: 5-17 dGH</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <P> Variation is important if you want to ensure that they get the necessary vitamins and nutrients to keep their systems running smoothly.<br/>
      This means a mixed diet of flake fish food and frozen or freeze-dried food is a great place to start.  <br/>
        For live food, we recommend Daphnia and brine shrimp as a great source of protein and nutrients.</p>
