       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>These fish are extremely pretty and their bright coloration makes them mesmerizing to watch swim around in your tank.</p>
        <p>The Ember Tetra is almost entirely orangeish-red and the brightness of their color holds true wherever it’s present on their body. This gives them a very distinct and sharp look that’s impossible to miss.</p>
        <p>They can be found most heavily in Central Brazil in the Araguaia River basin.</p>
       <p>They normally live 3 to 6 years in excellent conditions and grow to around 1 inch.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 10 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.</p>
      <p>A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish that are larger than them.</p>
        <p>They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that.</p>
        <p>Avoid aggressive species as they will bully your Ember tetras.</p>
        <p>Ideal tankmates include other small tetras, rainbowfish, and Corydoras catfish.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The recommended tank size for Ember Tetras is a minimum of 10 gallons.</p>
       <p>They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.</p>
      <p> In their natural habitat Ember Tetras are surrounded by heavy vegetation, so it’s what they’re comfortable with.</p>
    <p>Some of the best plants to include in their tanks are Java Moss, Hornwort, and Anacharis.</p>
      <P>Tetras like mild and steady water current. If the current is too strong, they will struggle to swim and will become stressed.</P>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <P> Variation is important if you want to ensure that they get the necessary vitamins and nutrients to keep their systems running smoothly.</P>
      <p>This means a mixed diet of flake fish food and frozen or freeze-dried food is a great place to start.  </p>
        <p>For live food, we recommend Daphnia and brine shrimp as a great source of protein and nutrients.</p>
