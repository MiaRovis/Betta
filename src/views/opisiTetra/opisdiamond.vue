       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>About</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The fish gets its common name from the gorgeous finish of its scales. Most of the body takes on a silvery hue. However, the scales have an iridescent shimmer than can flash colors of orange, blue, green, and gold.</p>
        <p>The diamond tetra is one of the stockier types of tetras out there. It’s a bit larger than most tetras, but it still features the same laterally compressed body.</p>
        <p>Originally from inland bodies of water in South America, the diamond tetra prefers to live in shallow and slow-moving tributaries. These fish are typically found in the Rio Bue, Rio Tiquiriti, and Lake Valencia.</p>
       <p>They normally live 3 to 6 years in excellent conditions and grow to around 2 inches.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 6 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.</p>
      <p>A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish with large fins and long tails as the are fin nippers.</p>
        <p>They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that.</p>
        <p>Avoid aggressive species, as they will bully your Diamond tetras.</p>
        <p>Ideal tankmates include other tetras, rainbowfish, and Corydoras catfish.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The recommended tank size for Diamond Tetras is a minimum of 15 gallons.</p>
       <p>They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.</p>
      <p> Diamond tetras do best in an Amazonian biotope setup which means they’re used to living in environments that are teeming with plant life.</p>
    <p>The plants need to provide adequate shelter from the light, as these fish do not like bright lights</p>
      <P>Tetras like mild and steady water current. If the current is too strong, they will struggle to swim and will become stressed.</P>
