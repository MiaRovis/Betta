       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        erpae tetras originate in the Amazon basin, inhabiting the Guaporé and Paraguay River basins in Argentina, Brazil, and upper Paraguay. <br/>
      Their deep red color, along with black spot behind the gills makes them stand out in the water.<br/>
        <p>They normally live 5 in excellent conditions and grow to around 1.75 inches.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 6 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.<br/>
     A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish that are larger than them.<br/>
        They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that.<br/>
        Avoid aggressive species as they will bully your tetras.<br/>
       Ideal tankmates include other tetras, rainbowfish, and Corydoras catfish.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The recommended tank size for Serpae Tetras is a minimum of 20 gallons.<br/>
       They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.<br/>
       In the wild, this species prefers still and slow-moving backwaters such as lakes, ponds, and streams. They often congregate around tree roots and thick vegetation where they can find both safety and food.<br/>
   It's best to leave an open swimming space with driftwood, plants, and décor around the edges to provide hiding places.<br/>
      Tetras like mild and steady water current. If the current is too strong, they will struggle to swim and will become stressed.</P>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Water parameters</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Though serpae tetras are easy to care for, they are not recommended for a newly set-up tank, as they are sensitive to changes in water parameters.<br/>
        Good water conditions are paramount when it comes to keeping your fish healthy. Poor quality can lead to unnecessary stress or a wide range of diseases. <br/>
      Temperature: 72°F to 79°F<br/>
         Amonia and Nitrite: 0ppm<br/>
    Nitrate: less then 20ppm <br/>
   PH:5.0 - 7.8<br/>
    GH: 5-25 dGH</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <P> In their natural environment, serpae tetras eat small live foods such as insects, invertebrates, and worms.<br/>
      In the aquarium, they will accept virtually any food quite readily, including flake, pellet, freeze-dried, and frozen foods.<br/>
        To keep them in prime condition and bring out their colors, feed a good variety of food types, including live foods when available.</p>
