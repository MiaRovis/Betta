        <p></p>
        <p>A cardinal tetra can be distinguished from a neon tetra by the red color band that extends the entire length of its body.</p>
        <p>Originating in South America, this species is found from the Orinoco River to the Rio Negro tributary of the Amazon River. It is found as far west as western Colombia.</p>
       <p>They normally live 4 years in excellent conditions and grow to around 2 inches.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Tetras are a shoaling fish, which means they live in groups of 6 minimum, so they have to be kept in a group in captivity also.</p>
      <p>A larger group makes the fish feel more comfortable and confident in their surroundings. In situations where this species has exceeded its expected lifespan, they’ve always been in a big group.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Tetras get along with almost any fish, but try to avoid fish with large fins and long tails as the are fin nippers.</p>
        <p>They are a peaceful fish so they can be kept with any fish that goes by that.</p>
        <p>Do not keep them with any fish that are known to eat smaller, slim-bodied fish. If the companion fish has a big enough mouth to swallow the cardinal tetra, it is not a suitable tank mate.</p>
        <p>Ideal tankmates for tetras are rasboras (not every kind!), dwarf gouramis, cory catfish and ramshorns.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The recommended tank size for Bloodfin Tetras is a minimum of 20 gallons.</p>
       <p>They are active swimmers, so a large tank with plenty of space is desirable.</p>
      <P>Lighting should be subdued, as should the décor. Floating plants are a good means for moderating the lighting. </P>
      <p>Although they require some hiding spaces, it is important to provide cardinal tetras with open-water swimming area as well. </p>
      <P>A well-planted tank with an open center space is an ideal habitat for this species. </P>
      <P>Tetras like mild and steady water current. If the current is too strong, they will struggle to swim and will become stressed.</P>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Water parameters</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline"> 
        <P>This species requires a mature tank that has soft, acidic water. More importantly, water chemistry should be stable. This is not a species that does well in a newly started aquarium.</P>
        <p>Good water conditions are paramount when it comes to keeping your fish healthy. Poor quality can lead to unnecessary stress or a wide range of diseases. </p>
      <p>Temperature: 73°F to 81°F</p>
         <p>Amonia and Nitrite: 0ppm</p>
    <p>Nitrate: less then 20ppm </p>
    <p>PH:6.0 - 8.0</p> 
    <p>GH: 2-10 dGH</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <P>The cardinal tetra is an omnivorous species and will accept most commercial fish foods. These fish have high vitamin requirements, so at least 75 percent of their food should be quality flake food.</P>
