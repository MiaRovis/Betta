       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The Galaxy Rasbora is a fish that dhas got a fantastic coloration on its body, the reason why it is one of the most sought tropical fish for aquariums.<br/>
        The first discovery of this fish was back in the year 2006 in Asia, Myanmar, in an area near the Salween River Basin.<br/>
    They live for about 3-5 years and grow up to 1 inch.</p>

       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Rasboras are very peaceful and non agressive in nature.<br/>
      They are shoaling fish so they have to be kept in groups of 15 or more.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasboras are very peaceful and non agressive towards other fish due to their small size and timid nature.<br/>
       They should not be kept with fish with long fins or tails, such as betta fish, because they are fin nippers.<br/>
    Also, do not keep them with fish larger than them as they will get bullied and hurt.<br/>
    Galaxy Rasbora should be kept alone, as they are very timid and small fish.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasboras should be kept in a tank that is minimum of 10 gallons.<br/>
       Galaxy rasbora spend most of their time at the bottom scavenging for food, so you can bury a lot of vegetation under the substrate to keep them entertained.<br/>
        They enjoy dark waters which means there should be an addition of driftwood and leaves.<br/>
       Filtration should be moderate as they enjoy slow-moving waters and can become stressed if the flow is too strong.<br/>
      The addition of dried leaf litter(beech, oak, almond..) would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering even more cover.<br/>
    The lighting should be moderate, but the enjoy sunlight so make sure the tank gets enought of natural light.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Galaxy Rasboras are omnivorous. That is, they feed on both plants and other animals, such as invertebrates.<br/>
       They are bottom-dwellers so make sure to gve them food that will sink to the bottom.<br/>
      In their natural habitat, they are always looking for food. They eat everything from algae to shrimp.<br/>
    You can feed them tiny live foods such as micro-worms, brine shrimp, and Daphnia. <br/>
   To give them a balanced diet, keep changing up their food items.</p>
