        <p>Also known as the Red-tailed Rasbora, the Blackline Rasbora has a striking silver body with a gold and black stripe running down its side to the caudal fin base which has a flare of red.<br/>
           This species originates in Asia’s Mekong, Chao Phraya, Mae Klong basins, and northern Malay Peninsula.
            They live for about 5-8 years and grow up to 2 inches.</p>

       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Rasboras are very peaceful and non agressive in nature.<br/>
         They are shoaling fish so they have to be kept in groups of 10 or more.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
    <p> Rasboras are not agressive towards other fish due to their small size and timid nature.<br/>
        They should not be kept with fish with long fins or tails, such as betta fish, because they are fin nippers.<br/>
        Also, do not keep them with fish larger than them as they will get bullied and hurt.<br/>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasboras should be kept in a tank that is minimum of 10 gallons.<br/>
        They enjoy dark waters which means there should be an addition of driftwood and leaves.<br/>
        Filtration should be moderate as they enjoy slow-moving waters and can become stressed if the flow is too strong.<br/>
        There should be plenty of plants in the tank as they like to hide.<br/>
        Blackline Rasboras enjoy low lighting.
