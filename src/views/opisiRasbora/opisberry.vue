       <div id="opis" class="multiline">

       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Rasboras are very peaceful and non agressive in nature.<br/>
      They are shoaling fish so they have to be kept in groups of 15 or more.<br/>
     There can be some agression inside the groups but that is only a sign of hierarchy establishing.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasboras are  not agressive towards other fish due to their small size and timid nature.<br/>
        They should not be kept with fish with long fins or tails, such as betta fish, because they are fin nippers.<br/>
    Also, do not keep them with fish larger than them as they will get bullied and hurt.<br/>
    They do best alone, but can easily be kept with tetras and any bottom-dwelling fish.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasboras should be kept in a tank that is minimum of 10 gallons.<br/>
       Strawberry Rasbora thrive best in an aquarium environment resembling their native habitat<br/>
        They enjoy dark waters which means there should be an addition of driftwood and leaves.<br/>
       Filtration should be moderate as they enjoy slow-moving waters and can become stressed if the flow is too strong.<br/>
      The addition of dried leaf litter(beech, oak, almond..) would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering even more cover.<br/>
    The lighting should be on the low to moderate side.</p>
