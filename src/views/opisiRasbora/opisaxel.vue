       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasbora Axelrodi is a small, quite rare freshwater fish.<br/>
      They have amazing colors of blue-green spangled bodies while males have some reddish area on their lower body.<br/>
    They originate from Greater Sunda Islands of Borneo and Sumatra.<br/>
    They live for about 2-5 years and grow up to 1 inch</p>

       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Rasboras are very peaceful and non agressive in nature.<br/>
      They are shoaling fish so they have to be kept in groups of 10 or more.<br/>
      There can be some agression inside the groups but that is only a sign of hierarchy establishing.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasboras are not agressive towards other fish due to their small size and timid nature.<br/>
        They should not be kept with fish with long fins or tails, such as betta fish, because they are fin nippers.<br/>
  Also, do not keep them with fish larger than them as they will get bullied and hurt.<br/>
    They do best alone, but can easily be kept with tetras and any bottom-dwelling fish.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasbora Axelrodi is best kept in a densely-planted tank with slightly acidic ph.<br/>
        They enjoy dark waters which means there should be an addition of driftwood in the tank which would result in lower ph and dark water.<br/>
       Filtration should be moderate as they enjoy slow-moving waters and can become stressed if the flow is too strong.<br/>
      The addition of dried leaf litter(beech, oak, almond..) would further emphasise the natural feel and as well as offering even more cover.<br/>
   The lighting should be on the low to moderate side.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Rasbora Axelrodi, in nature, feeds on smallaquatic crustaceans, worms, insect larvae and other zooplankton.<br/>
      It can be a little picky in the aquarium and may not accept dried foods although in some cases they will learn to take them over time.<br/>
    They should always be offered regular meals of small live or frozen fare such as Artemia nauplii, Daphnia, grindal, micro and chopped bloodworm in order to develop ideal colour and conditioning.</p>
