       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Rasboras are very peaceful and non agressive in nature.<br/>
      They are shoaling fish so they have to be kept in groups of 10 or more.</p>

      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasboras are very peaceful and non agressive towards other fish due to their small size and timid nature.<br/>
        They should not be kept with fish with long fins or tails, such as betta fish, because they are fin nippers.<br/>
    Also, do not keep them with fish larger than them as they will get bullied and hurt.<br/>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasboras should be kept in a tank that is minimum of 10 gallons.<br/>
        They enjoy dark waters which means there should be an addition of driftwood and leaves.<br/>
       Filtration should be moderate as they enjoy slow-moving waters and can become stressed if the flow is too strong.<br/>
 There should be plenty of plants in the tank as they like to hide.

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Harlequin Rasboras are omnivores. They’re highly opportunistic and will eat pretty much anything they can.<br/>
        The fish have tiny mouths that aren’t always capable of getting around common fish foods, so keep things as small as possible.<br/>
        It’s always a good idea to supplement dry food with live food every once in a while. Consider feeding your fish bloodworms, Daphnia, or brine shrimp for a good dose of protein.<br/>
