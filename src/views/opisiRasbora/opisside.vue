            Their bodies are bright silver with a black stripe.<br/>
            The species originates from Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam.<br/>

       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Rasboras are very peaceful and non agressive in nature.<br/>
         They are shoaling fish so they have to be kept in groups of 10 or more.</p>

      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
    <p> Rasboras are not agressive towards other fish due to their small size and timid nature.<br/>
        They should not be kept with fish with long fins or tails, such as betta fish, because they are fin nippers.<br/>
        Also, do not keep them with fish larger than them as they will get bullied and hurt.<br/>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Sidestripe Rasboras should be kept in a tank that is minimum of 30 gallons as they are very active, and bigger than other rasboras, in nature.<br/>
        They are very good jumpers and can escape through tinies gaps, so aquarium lids are a must.<br/>
        They enjoy dark waters which means there should be an addition of driftwood and leaves.<br/>
        Filtration should be moderate as they enjoy slow-moving waters and can become stressed if the flow is too strong.<br/>
        There should be plenty of plants in the tank as they like to hide.<br/>
        Also, there should be plenty of swimming space as they are very active swimmers.

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Sidestripe Rasboras will accept most god quality dried foods such as granules, flakes and sinking pellets. <br/>
        Providing additional foods such as live, frozen and freeze-dried meals such as bloodworms, daphnia and tubifex twice a week will provide additional benefits to their health and well-being.<br/>
       In addition, bloodworms should only be given as an occasional treat and should not be used as a staple diet.</p>
