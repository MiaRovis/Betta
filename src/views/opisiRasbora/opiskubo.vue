       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Kubotai Rasboras are perfect for aquarists looking to add a pop of color to their tanks. Their bodies are mostly a sparkling neon green color that is rarely seen in freshwater animals. <br/>
            The bright green color of these fish produce a contrast with other brightly-colored fish and invertebrates that is truly remarkable.<br/>
            These fish are tank-bred but idiginous to Thailand.
            They live for about 5-8 years and grow up to 3 inches.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
    <p> Rasboras are not agressive towards other fish due to their small size and timid nature.<br/>
        They should not be kept with fish with long fins or tails, such as betta fish, because they are fin nippers.<br/>
        Also, do not keep them with fish larger than them as they will get bullied and hurt.<br/>
    Kubotai Rasboras are very friendly, they even schoal with other small fish.</p>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Rasboras should be kept in a tank that is minimum of 10 gallons.<br/>
        They enjoy dark waters which means there should be an addition of driftwood and leaves.<br/>
        Filtration should be moderate as they enjoy slow-moving waters and can become stressed if the flow is too strong.<br/>
        There should be plenty of plants in the tank as they like to hide.
