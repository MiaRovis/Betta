       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>The scissortail rasbora is a freshwater fish of the rasbora family commonly found in the rivers of Southeast Asian countries. <br/>
            It is known as the three-lined rasbora due to its prominent line-markings.<br/>
            This species is native to the Mekong River Basin, bordered by Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand.<br/>
            They live for about 4-7 years and grow up to 3.5 inches.</p>

       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
       <p>Rasboras are very peaceful and non agressive in nature.<br/>
         They are shoaling fish so they have to be kept in groups of 10 or more.</p>

      <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
      <div id="opis" class="multiline">
    <p> Rasboras are not agressive towards other fish due to their small size and timid nature.<br/>
        They should not be kept with fish with long fins or tails, such as betta fish, because they are fin nippers.<br/>
        Also, do not keep them with fish larger than them as they will get bullied and hurt.<br/>

       <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
       <div id="opis" class="multiline">
        <p>Scissortail Rasboras should be kept in a tank that is minimum of 20 gallons as they are very active in nature.<br/>
        They enjoy dark waters which means there should be an addition of driftwood and leaves.<br/>
        Filtration should be moderate as they enjoy slow-moving waters and can become stressed if the flow is too strong.<br/>
        There should be plenty of plants in the tank as they like to hide.<br/>
        To simulate this natural habitat, keep scissortail rasboras in tanks with very low lighting.
