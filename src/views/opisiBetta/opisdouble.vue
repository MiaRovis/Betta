     <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>About</b></i></h4>
     <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>The Betta fish has the scientific name Betta splendens, and it is native to freshwater settings in Southeast Asia.<br/>
      They can grow up to 3 inches in length, and only live 3 to 4 years in excellent conditions.<br/>
      A double-tail betta is exactly what it sounds like — a Betta splendens with two tails.<br/>
     Due to a genetic mutation, double-tail bettas have a tail (or caudal fin) that splits down the middle. Some double-tail bettas even grow two different caudal fin lobes and have two distinct-looking tails.</p>

     <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
     <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Double tail bettas, like any other bettas, are knowns for agression towards other male Bettas and should not be kept in the same aquarium unless it's a very very large tank with plenty of hiding places.<br/>
   However, female bettas can be kept togehter, as they are unlikely to fight, but they also require a pretty large tank.</p>

    <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
    <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>You can house Betta fish with other species if chosen carefully, however, you must watch the aquarium activity and be prepared to act.<br/>
    Avoid tankmates with aggressive behaviors or that are larger than them. Tankmates with large fins may become targets of nipping.<br/>
    Bottom-dwelling species, like catfish, are a good choice. Tankmates that live towards the lower levels of the aquarium will not swim in the middle or upper layers that Betta fish prefer.<br/>
  Peaceful species, especially those with smaller fins, like tetras, can make potential tankmates - they add pretty color to the tank but will not act agressively towards bettas.</p>

     <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
     <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Double tail bettas will enjoy warm, fresh, slow-moving water with heavy plant life.<br/>
      The tank minimum is 10+ gallons.<br/>
      Live plants are the best decoration for your betta tank. Driftwood is also great because it can give your betta a natural place to hide.</p>

    <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Water parameters</b></i></h4>
     <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Bettas like warm, soft water free of contaminants and with a neutral pH.<br/>
    Plants can also convert nitrates into oxygen, which can help your tank stay clean and oxygenated.</p>
      <p>Temperature: 23.08° - 27.02°C<br/>
    Amonia and Nitrite: 0ppm<br/>
    Nitrate: less then 20ppm <br/>
    PH: 6.4 - 7.0<br/>
    GH: 3-4 dGH (50-66.7 ppm) <br/>
    KH: 3-5 dKH (53.6- 89.4 ppm)</p>

    <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
     <div id="opis" class="multiline">
     <p>Bettas are carnivores and require a diet of high-quality protein-rich foods such as live or frozen bloodworms and brine shrimp.<br/>
      Also, they can be fed high-quality Betta pellets or flakes. <br/>
      It's important not to overfeed them as this can cause health problems such as constipation and bloating.</p>
