  <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>About</b></i></h4>
  <div id="opis" class="multiline">
    <p>The Betta fish has the scientific name Betta splendens, and it is native to freshwater settings in Southeast Asia.<br/>
      They can grow up to 3 inches in length, and only live 3 to 4 years in excellent conditions.<br/>
  The tail of the species is what makes the Crowntail standout.<br/>
  They lack webbing between the rays on the fins. The webbing stops well short of the peaks, giving a spikey appearance, unlike the Combtail Betta.<br/>
  As with most Betta, male Crowntail Betta is more colorful than female Crowntail Betta.</p>>

  <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
  <div id="opis" class="multiline">
    <p>Like all Betta fish, Crowntail has a naturally aggressive disposition.<br/>
    That disposition has increased through generations of selective breeding among Betta fish keepers.<br/>
  While we feel this Betta fish is easy for beginners to care for, it requires more experience when housing with others.<br/>
    Therefore, You should never keep more than one male Crowntail in a community tank.</p>

  <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
  <div id="opis" class="multiline">
    <p>You can house Betta fish with other species if chosen carefully, however, you must watch the aquarium activity and be prepared to act.<br/>
Avoid tankmates with aggressive behaviors or that are larger than them. Tankmates with large fins may become targets of nipping.<br/>
  Bottom-dwelling species, like catfish, are a good choice. Tankmates that live towards the lower levels of the aquarium will not swim in the middle or upper layers that Betta fish prefer.<br/>
Peaceful species, especially those with smaller fins, like tetras, can make potential tankmates - they add pretty color to the tank but will not act agressively towards bettas.</p>

  <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
  <div id="opis" class="multiline">
    <p>Crowntail bettas require a medium to large size tank (10+ gallons), highly planted with live plants and plenty of hiding places, as the like to hide.<br/>
    They enjoy warm, slow-moving water and the light should be light to moderate.</p>
</div>
  <br/>
<h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Water parameters</b></i></h4>
 <div id="opis" class="multiline">
  <p>Bettas like warm, soft water free of contaminants and with a neutral pH.<br/>
    Plants can also convert nitrates into oxygen, which can help your tank stay clean and oxygenated.<br/>
  Temperature: 23.08° - 27.02°C<br/>
  Amonia and Nitrite: 0ppm<br/>
  Nitrate: less then 20ppm <br/>
  PH: 6.4 - 7.0<br/>
  GH: 3-4 dGH (50-66.7 ppm) <br/>
  KH: 3-5 dKH (53.6- 89.4 ppm)</p>

  <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
 <div id="opis" class="multiline">
  <p>Bettas are carnivores and require a diet of high-quality protein-rich foods such as live or frozen bloodworms and brine shrimp.<br/>
    Also, they can be fed high-quality Betta pellets or flakes. <br/>
   It's important not to overfeed them as this can cause health problems such as constipation and bloating.</p>
