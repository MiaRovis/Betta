     <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>About</b></i></h4>
     <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>The Betta fish has the scientific name Betta splendens, and it is native to freshwater settings in Southeast Asia.</p>
      <p>They can grow up to 3 inches in length, and only live 3 to 4 years in excellent conditions.</p>
      <p>Sometimes mistaken for other bettas, the fan tail has a single tail that’s round and full.</p>

     <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Tankmates</b></i></h4>
     <div id="opis" class="multiline">
     <p>Fantail Bettas, like any other bettas, are known for their aggression towards other male Bettas and should not be kept in the same aquarium unless it's a very very large tank with plenty of hiding places.</p>
     <p>However, female bettas can be kept togehter, as they are unlikely to fight, but they also require a pretty large tank.</p>

    <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Community tank</b></i></h4>
    <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>You can house Betta fish with other species if chosen carefully, however, you must watch the aquarium activity and be prepared to act.</p>
    <p>Avoid tankmates with aggressive behaviors or that are larger than them. Tankmates with large fins may become targets of nipping.</p>
    <p>Bottom-dwelling species, like catfish, are a good choice. Tankmates that live towards the lower levels of the aquarium will not swim in the middle or upper layers that Betta fish prefer.</p>
  <p>Peaceful species, especially those with smaller fins, like tetras, can make potential tankmates - they add pretty color to the tank but will not act agressively towards bettas.</p>

     <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Habitat requirements</b></i></h4>
     <div id="opis" class="multiline">
      <p>Faintail bettas require a medium to large size tank (10+ gallons), highly planted with live plants.</p>
      <p>They enjoy warm, slow-moving waters with planty of hiding places, so driftwood can be a great addition to the tank.</p>
      <p>The light should be light to moderate.</p>

    <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Water parameters</b></i></h4>
     <div id="opis" class="multiline"> 
      <p>Bettas like warm, soft water free of contaminants and with a neutral pH.</p>
      <p>Plants can also convert nitrates into oxygen, which can help your tank stay clean and oxygenated.</p>
    <p>Temperature: 23.08° - 27.02°C</p>
    <p>Amonia and Nitrite: 0ppm</p>
    <p>Nitrate: less then 20ppm </p>
    <p>PH: 6.4 - 7.0</p>
    <p>GH: 3-4 dGH (50-66.7 ppm) </p>
    <p>KH: 3-5 dKH (53.6- 89.4 ppm)</p>

    <h4 id="naslov1"><i><b>Diet and feeding</b></i></h4>
     <div id="opis" class="multiline">
     <p>Bettas are carnivores and require a diet of high-quality protein-rich foods such as live or frozen bloodworms and brine shrimp.</p>
      <p>Also, they can be fed high-quality Betta pellets or flakes. </p>
      <p>It's important not to overfeed them as this can cause health problems such as constipation and bloating.</p>
